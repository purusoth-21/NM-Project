Crime Incident Data Analysis Project
This project explores a dataset of crime incidents sourced from data.gov. The goal is to provide insights into crime trends, patterns, and distributions within the dataset. By applying various data analysis techniques, this project aims to uncover meaningful information that could be valuable for researchers, policymakers, and the general public.

Key Objectives:

Data Exploration and Cleaning: Understanding the structure of the dataset, identifying missing values, handling inconsistencies, and preparing the data for analysis.
Temporal Analysis: Investigating crime trends over time, identifying peak periods, and analyzing seasonal or cyclical patterns.
Spatial Analysis (if location data is available): Visualizing crime hotspots, understanding geographical distributions, and identifying areas with higher or lower crime rates.
Categorical Analysis: Examining the types of crimes committed, their frequency, and their relationships with other variables.
Identifying Potential Correlates: Exploring potential relationships between crime incidents and other relevant factors present in the dataset (e.g., time of day, day of the week, location features).
Data Visualization: Presenting findings through clear and informative visualizations such as charts, graphs, and maps (if applicable).
